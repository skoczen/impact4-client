This repository is the base for impact4 surveys.

To use impact4 (i4), create a configuration.xml file in the resources folder.

i4 is a powerful, nonlinear survey framework with back-end data support.  Its documentation is sparse, and like many projects, its source code has been spread around.  Hopefully that will improve.

As of September 2010, this repository is the canonical place for the i4 client.

To create a survey, checkout a copy of the client, and edit your configuration.xml as needed.
